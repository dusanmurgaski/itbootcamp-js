    <h1> Elektron (company)</h1>
    <p class="paragrafi">Elektron is a Swedish developer and manufacturer of 
        musical instruments founded in 1998, as well as having
        its headquarters, R&D and production in Gothenburg, 
        Sweden.
    </p>
    <h2>Product History</h2>
    <p class="paragrafi1i2">The first Elektron product was an analog/digital hybrid 
        tabletop synthesizer called the SidStation. Its sound
         engine was a Commodore 64 SID chip. During the years 
         2001-2003, Elektron released the Machinedrum 
         (a 16-voice digital drum machine) and the Monomachine
          (a programmable 6-voice synthesizer using single-cycle 
          waveforms). These instruments were, like the SidStation, 
          housed in a brushed aluminum casing.
    </p>
    <p class="paragrafi1i2">Since then, the range of products has been extended to
         include the following hardware: The Octatrack (a sampler),
          Digitakt (a sampler), Analog Keys & Analog Four 
          (keyboard/tabletop 4-voice analog synthesizer), 
          Analog Rytm (an 8-voice hybrid analog/digital drum machine)
           and Analog Heat (an 8-effects programmable analog sound
            processing unit).
